    <h1>Blockdown.</h1>
    <h3>Coming soon to iOS and Android.</h3>

    <!-- <h2>Bd</h2> -->

    <!-- <p>Blockdown is an all-in-one solution to quitting social media. With the app's absolute approach to the problem, it can
    tackle any social media addiction, no matter its severity. Unlike other prevention apps, Blockdown handles the problem
    at its core. It restricts user access to the chosen social media by changing the user credentials of that social media
    account for a committed period of time. <br>

    <br>
    
    Blockdown is the only app on the market that is able to provide absolute blockage of selected social media apps on
    Android, without the need for administrator rights or root, and the only app on iOS that is able to effectively block
    social media. <br>

    <br>
    
    Blockdown solves quite a lot of problems when it comes to curing a difficult addiction. Since it is absolute and takes
    effect across all platforms it ensures that there is no way for the user to start using social media again during the
    “blockdown”. For detailed information on the concept please read the business plan and watch the pitch.
